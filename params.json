{"name":"BlocksKit","body":"[BlocksKit](http://zwaldowski.github.com/BlocksKit)\r\n===================================================\r\n\r\nBlocks in C and Objective-C are downright magical.  They make coding easier and potentially quicker, not to mention faster on the front end with multithreading and Grand Central Dispatch.  BlocksKit hopes to facilitate this kind of programming by removing some of the annoying - and, in some cases, impeding - limits on coding with blocks.\r\n\r\nBlocksKit includes: basic block calling; key value observing extensions; filtering and enumeration for mutable and immutable collections; `NSInvocation` from a block; block-based timers, controls, and gesture recognizers; block-based alert views and action sheets; and block-backed delegation alternatives to `NSURLConnection`, `NSCache`, `MFMailComposeViewController`, `MFMessageComposeViewController`, and `UIWebView`.\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n============\r\n\r\nBlocksKit is a framework and static library for Mac OS X 10.6+ and iOS 4.0+. Use of BlocksKit on iOS requires linking against Core Graphics, MessageUI, and UIKit.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nBlocksKit can be added to a project using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), or through the methods described below.\r\n\r\n### Framework\r\n\r\n* Download a release of BlocksKit.\r\n* Move BlocksKit.framework to your project's folder.  Drag it from there into your project.\r\n* Add BlocksKit.framework to \"Link Binary With Libraries\" in your app's target. Make sure your app is linked with CoreGraphics, Foundation, MessageUI, and UIKit.\r\n* In the build settings of your target or project, change \"Other Linker Flags\" (`OTHER_LDFLAGS`) to `-ObjC -all_load`.\r\n* Insert `#import <BlocksKit/BlocksKit.h>` in your project's prefix header.\r\n* Make amazing software.\r\n\r\n### Library\r\n\r\n* Download a release of BlocksKit.\r\n* Move libBlocksKit.a and Headers to your project's folder, preferably a subfolder like \"Vendor\".\r\n* In \"Build Phases\", drag libBlocksKit.a into your target's \"Link Binary With Libraries\" build phase. \r\n* In the build settings of your target or project, change \"Other Linker Flags\" to `-ObjC -all_load`. Make sure your app is linked with CoreGraphics, Foundation, MessageUI, and UIKit.\r\n* Change (or add) to \"Header Search Paths\" the relative path to BlocksKit's headers, like `$(SRCROOT)/Vendor/Headers`.\r\n* Insert `#import <BlocksKit/BlocksKit.h>` in your project's prefix header.\r\n\r\nDownload\r\n========\r\n\r\nYou can download this project in either [zip](https://github.com/zwaldowski/BlocksKit/zipball/master) or [tar](https://github.com/zwaldowski/BlocksKit/tarball/master) formats.\r\n\r\nYou can also clone the project with Git by running:\r\n\r\n    $ git clone git://github.com/zwaldowski/BlocksKit\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n=============\r\n\r\nAn Xcode 4 compatible documentation set is available [using this Atom link](http://zwaldowski.github.com/BlocksKit/com.dizzytechnology.BlocksKit.atom). Add it to Xcode 4's preferences and it'll download automatically.
