Overview
========

Blocks in C and Objective-C are downright magical.  They make coding easier and potentially quicker, not to mention faster on the front end with multithreading and Grand Central Dispatch.  BlocksKit hopes to facilitate this kind of programming by removing some of the annoying - and, in some cases, impeding - limits on coding with blocks.

BlocksKit is a framework andr static library for iOS 4.0+ and Mac OS X 10.6+.

What's In The Box
=================

* Performing blocks on an `NSObject`.
* Key-value observation (`<NSKeyValueObserving>`) with block handlers.
* Associated objects in an Obj-C API.  (Not directly block-related.)
* `NSArray`, `NSSet`, `NSDictionary`, and `NSIndexSet` filtering and enumeration.
* Macros for more quickly typing out the above.
* `NSInvocation` creation using a block.
* `NSTimer` block execution.
* Both delegation and block callbacks on `NSURLConnection`.
* Delegate callback for `NSCache`.

### UIKit Extensions

* `UIAlertView`, `UIActionSheet` with block callbacks and convenience methods.
* Block initializers for `UIControl` and `UIBarButtonItem`
* Block-backed initializers for `UIGestureRecognizer`.
* On-touch utilities for `UIView`.
* Block callbacks for `MFMailComposeViewController` and `MFMessageComposeViewController`.
* Delegate alternative for `UIWebView`.


Installation
============

BlocksKit can be added to a project using [CocoaPods](https://github.com/alloy/cocoapods).

### Release/Framework Build

* Download a release of BlocksKit.
* Move BlocksKit.framework to your project's folder.  Drag it from there into your project.
* In the build settings of your target or project, change "All Linker Flags" to `-ObjC`.
* Insert `#import <BlocksKit/BlocksKit.h>` in any header file (including your project's prefix header).
* Make amazing software.

### Testing/Library Build

* Clone the repository.
* Click-and-drag the BlocksKit project into a project or workspace.
* In the build phases of a target, add libBlocksKit.a to the "Target Dependencies" and "Link Binary with Libraries".
* In the build settings, change "All Linker Flags" to `-ObjC` and "Header Search Paths" to `$(BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR)/../BlocksKit/**`.
 * If you are using Xcode 4.2 with the iOS 5.0 SDK on a **non-ARC** target, set "All Linker Flags" to `-ObjC -fobjc-arc`.  
* In any header file, insert `#import "BlocksKit/BlocksKit.h"`.  It is not recommended to insert the import statement in your project prefix, as it could break Xcode 4's Code Sense.


Documentation
=============

Documentation is exhaustive and done using [AppleDoc](https://github.com/tomaz/appledoc).  

An Xcode 4 compatible documentation set is available [using this Atom link](http://www.dizzytechnology.com/data/com.dizzytech.BlocksKit.atom).  Add it to Xcode 4's preferences and it'll download automatically.

You can also view the documentation online [at my website](http://dizzytechnology.com/data/BlocksKit).
